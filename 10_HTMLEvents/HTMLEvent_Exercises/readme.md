## About Project

For this project's exercise, I will be practing creating project using event listeners and event handlers. This way my code will be asynchronous and can respond to thr user's input.

### Color Changer

In my app, there are three square div elements that are all gray colored. Using an event handler, write an event listener to listen when a div is being clicked on. When one of the divs are clicked on by the user, the color of the div will change color.

### Color Mixer

In this app, there will be a black div with buttons below it. These buttons control the rgb color values of the black div.

### Flash Cards

This app has three buttons that will ask the user questions. When a question appear, each button will have a data-answer attribute that lists the answer.
When a Button is clicked, the anwser to that button's question will display in a div.
